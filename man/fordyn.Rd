\title{Forest dynamics}
\description{
Function \code{fordyn} implements a forest dynamics model that simulates growth, mortality and recruitment for plant cohorts in a given forest stand during a period specified in the input climatic data. 
}
\usage{
fordyn(forest, soil, SpParams, meteo, control,
       latitude , elevation = NA, slope = NA, aspect = NA) 
}
\arguments{
  \item{forest}{An object of class \code{\link{forest}}.}
  \item{soil}{An object of class \code{\link{soil}}.}
  \item{SpParams}{A data frame with species parameters (see \code{\link{SpParamsMED}} and \code{\link{SpParamsMED}}).}
  \item{meteo}{A data frame with daily meteorological data series. Row names of the data frame should correspond to date strings with format "yyyy-mm-dd" (see \code{\link{Date}}).}
  \item{control}{A list with default control parameters (see \code{\link{defaultControl}}).}
  \item{latitude}{Latitude (in degrees). Required when \code{x$TranspirationMode = "Sperry"}.}
  \item{elevation, slope, aspect}{Elevation above sea level (in m), slope (in degrees) and aspect (in degrees from North). Required when \code{x$TranspirationMode = "Sperry"}. Elevation is also required for 'Granier' if snowpack dynamics are simulated.}
}
\details{
  Function \code{fordyn} simulates forest dynamics for annual time steps, building on other simulation functions. For each simulated year, the function performs the following steps:
  \enumerate{
  \item{Calls function \code{\link{growth}} to simulate daily water/carbon balance, growth and mortality processes.}
  \item{Simulate recruitment (for species present in the stand).}
  \item{Prepares the input of function \code{\link{growth}} for the next annual time step.}
  \item{Store forest status and summaries.}
  }
}
\value{
  A list of class 'fordyn' with the following elements:
  \itemize{
 \item{\code{"StandSummary"}: A data frame with stand-level summaries (leaf area index, tree basal area, tree density, shrub cover, etc.) at the beginning of the simulation and after each simulated year.}
 \item{\code{"SpeciesSummary"}: A data frame with species-level summaries (leaf area index, tree basal area, tree density, shrub cover, etc.) at the beginning of the simulation and after each simulated year.}
 \item{\code{"CohortSummary"}: A data frame with cohort-level summaries (leaf area index, tree basal area, tree density, shrub cover, etc.) at the beginning of the simulation and after each simulated year.}
 \item{\code{"TreeTable"}: A data frame with tree-cohort data (species, density, diameter, height, etc.) at the beginning of the simulation (if any) and after each simulated year.}
 \item{\code{"DeadTreeTable"}: A data frame with dead tree-cohort data (species, density, diameter, height, etc.) at the beginning of the simulation and after each simulated year.}
 \item{\code{"ShrubTable"}: A data frame with shrub-cohort data (species, density, cover, height, etc.) at the beginning of the simulation and after each simulated year.}
 \item{\code{"DeadShrubTable"}: A data frame with dead shrub-cohort data (species, density, cover, height, etc.) at the beginning of the simulation (if any) and after each simulated year.}
 \item{\code{"ForestStructures"}: A list with the \code{\link{forest}} object of the stand at the beginning of the simulation and after each simulated year.}
 \item{\code{"GrowthResults"}: A list with the results of calling function \code{\link{growth}} for each simulated year.}
