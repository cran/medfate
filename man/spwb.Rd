\title{Soil-plant water balance}
\description{
Function \code{spwb()} is a water balance model that determines changes in soil moisture, soil water potentials and plant transpiration and drought stress at daily steps for a given forest stand during a period specified in the input climatic data. Additionally, the function also calculates plant net photosynthesis. Transpiration and photosynthesis processes are conducted with different level of detail depending on the transpiration mode.

\usage{
spwb(x, soil, meteo,  latitude = NA, elevation = NA, slope = NA, aspect = NA)
spwb.resetInputs(x, soil, from = NULL, day = NA)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{An object of class \code{\link{spwbInput}}.}
  \item{soil}{A list containing the description of the soil (see \code{\link{soil}}).}
  \item{meteo}{A data frame with daily meteorological data series. Row names of the data frame should correspond to date strings with format "yyyy-mm-dd" (see \code{\link{Date}}). When using the 'Simple' transpiration mode the following columns are required:
   \itemize{
     \item{\code{MeanTemperature}: Mean temperature (in degrees Celsius).}
     \item{\code{Precipitation}: Precipitation (in mm).}
     \item{\code{Radiation}: Solar radiation (in MJ/m2/day), required only if \code{snowpack = TRUE}.}
     \item{\code{PET}: Potential evapotranspiration (in mm).}
    }
  When using the 'Complex' transpiration mode the following columns are required:
   \itemize{
     \item{\code{MeanTemperature}: Mean temperature (in degrees Celsius).}
     \item{\code{MinTemperature}: Minimum temperature (in degrees Celsius).}
     \item{\code{MaxTemperature}: Maximum temperature (in degrees Celsius).}
     \item{\code{MinRelativeHumidity}: Minimum relative humidity (in percent).}
     \item{\code{MaxRelativeHumidity}: Maximum relative humidity (in percent).}
     \item{\code{Precipitation}: Precipitation (in mm).}
     \item{\code{Radiation}: Solar radiation (in MJ/m2/day).}
     \item{\code{WindSpeed}: Wind speed (in m/s). If not available, this column can be left with \code{NA} values.}
    }
  }
  \item{latitude}{Latitude (in degrees). Required when using the 'Complex' transpiration mode.}
  \item{elevation, slope, aspect}{Elevation above sea level (in m), slope (in degrees) and aspect (in degrees from North). Required when using the 'Complex' transpiration mode. Elevation is also required for 'Simple' if snowpack dynamics are simulated.}
  \item{from}{An object of class \code{spwb} storing the results of a previous simulation, including values of state variables. If \code{from = NULL}, state variables are set to their defaults (i.e. soil moisture set to field capacity and cumulative growth degree days set to zero).}
  \item{day}{An integer with the day from which state variable values stored in \code{from} should be copied. If missing, values are copied from the first day of stored values.}
}
\details{
  Detailed model description is available in the vignettes section. The model using 'Simple' transpiration mode is described in De Caceres et al. (2015). Simulations using the 'Complex' transpiration mode are computationally much more expensive. Function \code{spwb.resetInputs()} allows resetting state variables in \code{x} and \code{soil} to their defaults, or to copy values of state variables from a previous \code{spwb()} simulation results stored in \code{from}.

\note{
State variables stored in objects \code{x} and \code{soil} are modified during the simulation. Use function \code{spwb.resetInputs()} to reset state variables to defaults. Daily transpiration and photosynthesis values are stored in columns \code{Transpiration} and \code{Photosynthesis} of object \code{x}. Water content relative to field capacity (vector \code{W}) of \code{soil} is also modified.
