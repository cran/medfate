\details{
  Detailed model description is available in the vignettes section. The model using 'Simple' transpiration mode is described in De Caceres et al. (2015). Simulations using the 'Complex' transpiration mode are computationally much more expensive.

Objects \code{x} and \code{soil} are modified during the simulation. Daily transpiration and photosynthesis values are stored in columns \code{Transpiration} and \code{Photosynthesis} of object \code{x}. Water content relative to field capacity (vector \code{W}) of \code{soil} is also modified.
